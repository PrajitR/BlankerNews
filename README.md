# Blanker News

Easily customize a ready made Hacker News skeleton for any community you want.

## Setup

This uses Node.js and MongoDB. You need to install both. Then:

  npm install

for dependencies. Then start running a MongoDB instance. The database will be `users` (though you can change it in `index.js`. To run:

  node index.js

For tests, either of these work:
 
  npm test
  make test

## Status

There is more work to be done, but at the moment, I'm done with this.
